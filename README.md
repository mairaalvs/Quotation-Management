### ðŸ’» How it works

The application developed, called Quotation Management, is a REST based application whose purpose is to store quotes from stock market. A user can register as many quotes as he wants for the same stock and a user can register quotes from different stocks. But, a stock can only be registered in Quotation Management if it is already registered in Stock Manager.

To register a new stock in Stock Manager:
#### POST http://localhost:8080/stock
```
{
    "id": "mglu3", 
    "description": "Magazine Luiza" 
}
```

To read all stocks from Stock Manager:
#### GET http://localhost:8080/stock

With the stock registered in the Stock Manager, we can start registering in Quotation Management.


To register a new stock in Quotation Management:
#### POST http://localhost:8081/stock
{
	"stockId": "mglu3",
	"quotesMap": {
		"2022-03-10": 15.40
	}
}

To read all stocks from Quotation Management:
#### GET http://localhost:8081/stock
	
To read only one stock in Quote Management:	
#### GET http://localhost:8081/stock/stockId
